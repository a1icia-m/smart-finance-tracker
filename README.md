## Work in Progress
ðŸš§ Currently developing a smart AI-powered finance tracker platform to learn and develop my full-stack engineering skills! Leveraging Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Gemini AI to build an intelligent budgeting interface with persistent state, modular components, and interactive UI. Focused on creating scalable, user-centric features using clean architecture and learn the best practices in component-based design.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
